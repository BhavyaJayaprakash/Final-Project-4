## Overview:
This project uses historical NBA team statistics to predict the 2025 NBA CHampion. Leveraging classification models like Random Forest and Linear Regression, we evaluate how regular season performance metrics contribute to playoff success and championship outcomes.

## Goals

Predict wjeater a team will become NBA champion using bianary classification

Identify key statiscal patterns and features correlated with championship teams.

Compare Model accuracy, precision and feature importance

convert probabilities into visual formats like pie charts and money lines

## Data Collection:

## Models Used

Random Forest Classifier
 Best performing classifier so far

 Handles nonlinear feature interactions

 Useful for identifying most important predictive features

 ## Prediction Output

 2025 playoff teams ranked by predicted probability

 Cahrt visualization of championship chances

 Monat Line conversion based on model probabilities
